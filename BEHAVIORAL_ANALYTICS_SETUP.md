# Behavioral Analytics Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up and use Behavioral Analytics in your Emory Search application.

## What is Behavioral Analytics?

Based on the [Elastic Behavioral Analytics documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.18/behavioral-analytics-overview.html), Behavioral Analytics is an analytics event collection platform that helps you:

- Analyze users' searching and clicking behavior
- Improve the relevance of your search results
- Identify gaps in your content
- Track user engagement patterns

## Features Implemented

‚úÖ **Search Tracking**: Automatically tracks all search queries with metadata
‚úÖ **Click Tracking**: Tracks when users click on search results
‚úÖ **Page View Tracking**: Tracks page visits and navigation
‚úÖ **Custom Properties**: Includes search mode, index selection, and Emory-specific data
‚úÖ **GDPR Compliant**: No personal data collection, only anonymous session tracking

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Analytics Collection in Kibana

First, you need to create a Behavioral Analytics collection in your Elasticsearch deployment:

1. **Access Kibana**: Go to your Elasticsearch Cloud deployment
2. **Navigate to Analytics**: Go to `Analytics` > `Behavioral Analytics`
3. **Create Collection**: Click "Create collection"
4. **Name**: Use `emory-search-analytics` (or your preferred name)
5. **Save**: Your collection is now ready

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Update your `.env` file with the analytics configuration:

```env
# Main Application API Key (for search operations)
VITE_ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY=your_main_app_api_key_here

# Analytics API Key (for behavioral analytics) - Optional but recommended
VITE_ANALYTICS_API_KEY=your_analytics_api_key_here

# Behavioral Analytics Configuration
VITE_ANALYTICS_COLLECTION_NAME=emory-search-analytics
VITE_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true
VITE_ANALYTICS_DEBUG=false
```

**Note**: If you don't provide a separate `VITE_ANALYTICS_API_KEY`, the system will use the main `VITE_ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY` for analytics. For better security, create separate API keys as described in `API_KEYS_SETUP.md`.

### 3. Verify Installation

The analytics package has been installed and configured:

```bash
npm install @elastic/behavioral-analytics-javascript-tracker
```

## What Gets Tracked

### Search Events
- **Query**: The search term entered by the user
- **Search Mode**: Text search or ELSER semantic search
- **Selected Index**: Which index was searched (Both/Main/News)
- **Total Results**: Number of results returned
- **Timestamp**: When the search occurred

### Click Events
- **Document URL**: The clicked result URL
- **Document Title**: The title of the clicked result
- **Click Position**: Position in the search results (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- **Search Context**: The original query that led to the click
- **Search Mode**: Which search mode was used

### Page View Events
- **Page URL**: Current page URL
- **Page Title**: Document title
- **Referrer**: Previous page
- **Session Info**: Anonymous session tracking

## Privacy & GDPR Compliance

The implementation is fully GDPR compliant:

- ‚úÖ **No Personal Data**: No IP addresses, names, or personal information collected
- ‚úÖ **Anonymous Sessions**: Uses anonymous user and session tokens
- ‚úÖ **Cookie-Based**: `EA_UID` (24 hours) and `EA_SID` (30 minutes) cookies only
- ‚úÖ **Transparent**: All tracking is logged to console in debug mode

## Analytics Data Structure

### Search Event Example
```json
{
  "search": {
    "query": "emory university admissions",
    "results": {
      "total_results": 42
    }
  },
  "custom_properties": {
    "search_mode": "elser",
    "selected_index": "both",
    "source": "emory_search_ui"
  }
}
```

### Click Event Example
```json
{
  "search": {
    "query": "emory university admissions"
  },
  "document": {
    "id": "https://emory.edu/admissions"
  },
  "custom_properties": {
    "document_url": "https://emory.edu/admissions",
    "document_title": "Emory University Admissions",
    "click_position": 1,
    "search_mode": "elser",
    "source": "emory_search_ui"
  }
}
```

## Viewing Analytics Data

### In Kibana
1. Go to `Analytics` > `Behavioral Analytics`
2. Select your collection (`emory-search-analytics`)
3. View dashboards showing:
   - Search volume and trends
   - Popular queries
   - Click-through rates
   - User journey patterns

### Custom Dashboards
The analytics data is stored in Elasticsearch indices, so you can create custom visualizations:

- **Search Patterns**: Most popular search terms
- **Content Gaps**: Searches with no clicks
- **Search Mode Performance**: Text vs ELSER effectiveness
- **Index Usage**: Which content sources are most popular

## Debugging

### Enable Debug Mode
Set `VITE_ANALYTICS_DEBUG=true` in your `.env` file to see detailed console logs.

### Console Output
When debug mode is enabled, you'll see:
```
üîç Behavioral Analytics initialized for collection: emory-search-analytics
üìä Search tracked: { query: "admissions", searchMode: "text", selectedIndex: "both", totalResults: 15 }
üñ±Ô∏è Click tracked: { query: "admissions", documentId: "...", documentUrl: "...", position: 1 }
üìÑ Page view tracked: { pageUrl: "...", pageTitle: "..." }
```

### Troubleshooting

**Analytics not initializing?**
- Check that `VITE_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true`
- Verify `VITE_ANALYTICS_COLLECTION_NAME` matches your Kibana collection
- Ensure your API key has analytics permissions

**Events not appearing in Kibana?**
- Wait a few minutes for data to process
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify CORS settings allow analytics requests

**Performance concerns?**
- Analytics events are sent asynchronously
- Minimal impact on search performance
- Events are batched for efficiency

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Event Tracking
You can track custom events using the analytics utilities:

```typescript
import { trackCustomEvent } from './analytics';

// Track custom user interactions
trackCustomEvent('filter_applied', {
  filter_type: 'source',
  filter_value: 'emory.edu'
});
```

### Analytics API Access
Access the raw analytics tracker for advanced features:

```typescript
import { getAnalyticsTracker } from './analytics';

const tracker = getAnalyticsTracker();
if (tracker) {
  // Use advanced tracker features
}
```
